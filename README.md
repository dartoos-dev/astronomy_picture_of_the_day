## Overview

This is a Flutter app project to display NASA's astronomy picture of the day.

## Getting Started

This project is a fully functional example, focussed on showing
astronomy-related images by making http requests to NASA's public APIs.

You can take the code in this project and experiment with it.

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/dartoos-dev/astronomy_picture_of_the_day.git
  cd astronomy_picrture_of_the_day
```

## Running the App

As it is a Flutter project, you can run it on different platforms â€” Android,
IoS, Web, etc. But before running the application, you need to know which
devices are connected to your computer; you can achieve this by listing all
devices with the following terminal command:

```shell
  flutter devices
```

The above command will display a list similar to:

</p>

Running the app on one of the listed devices in debug mode:

#### Android

```shell
  flutter run -d RQCW70
```

#### IoS

```shell
  flutter run -d 257E76
```

#### Chrome

```shell
  flutter run -d chrome
```
